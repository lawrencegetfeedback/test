GetFeedback, Inc. 

Attn: Copyright Agent 

631 Howard St., 5th Floor,

        10. Your notice should provide the following information:

            1. an electronic or physical signature of the copyright owner or someone authorized to act on their behalf; 

            2. the name, address, telephone number, and email address of the copyright owner; 

            3. identification of the copyrighted work that is allegedly being infringed;

            4. identification of where the allegedly infringing material is located on Our Site or Services; 

            5. a statement that you have a good faith belief that the use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and 

            6. a statement that the information in your notice is accurate, and you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner. This statement must be made under penalty of perjury. 

        11. By submitting the notice, you acknowledge and agree that We may forward the information to the person who uploaded the allegedly infringing material. If you believe that your removed or disabled Content is not infringing, or that you have the authorization or right to post and use that Content from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to law, you may send a counter-notice containing the information required by Section 512(g)(3) of the DMCA (17 U.S.C. § 512(g)(3)). We will forward your counter-notification to the party who submitted the original copyright infringement claim. If the original claimant does not file an action seeking a court order to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity related to the removed or disabled Content within fifteen (15) calendar days of receiving the counter-notice from Us, then We may, in Our sole discretion, reinstate the removed or disabled Content.

    53. *Force Majeure.* We will not be liable for any delays or failure in performance of any part of the Services, from any cause beyond Our control. This includes, but is not limited to, acts of God, changes to law or regulations, embargoes, war, terrorist acts, riots, fires, earthquakes, nuclear accidents, floods, strikes, power blackouts, and acts of government, hackers or third-party internet services providers.

    54. *Governing Law.* The laws of California, USA, excluding California's conflict of laws rules, will apply to any and all disputes arising out or relating to the Services or this Agreement ("Disputes").

    55. *Export Regulations.* You will comply with all applicable laws and regulations controlling the export of certain commodities and technical data, including without limitation all Export Control Regulations of the United States Department of Commerce. Among other things, these laws and regulations prohibit or require a license for the export of certain types of commodities and technical data to specified countries.

    56. *Disputes.* You and GetFeedback, Inc. each agree to exclusively arbitrate any and all Disputes. YOU AND GETFEEDBACK, INC. AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE AGAINST THE OTHER MAY ONLY BE BROUGHT ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED, AND YOU ARE FOREGOING A JURY TRIAL AND WAIVING ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST GETFEEDBACK, INC. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision shall be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms shall be enforced (but in no case shall there be a class arbitration). All Disputes shall be resolved finally and exclusively by binding individual arbitration with a single arbitrator administered by the American Arbitration Association (www.adr.org) or JAMS (www.jamsadr.org) according to this provision and the applicable arbitration rules for that forum. Consumer claimants (individuals whose use of the Services is intended for personal, family, or household use) may elect to pursue their claims in their local small-claims court rather than through arbitration. The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, fully applies. If You are a consumer bringing a claim relating to personal, household, or family use, any arbitration hearing will occur within the county or parish where You reside. Otherwise, any arbitration hearing will occur in San Francisco, California, or another mutually agreeable location. The arbitrator's award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. For any Dispute, GetFeedback, Inc. will pay all the arbitration fees. If You prevail on any claim for which You are legally entitled to attorney’s fees, You may recover those fees from the arbitrator. For any claim where You are seeking relief, GetFeedback, Inc. will not seek to have You pay its attorney’s fees, even if fees might otherwise be awarded, unless the arbitrator determines that Your claim was frivolous. For purposes of this arbitration provision, references to You and GetFeedback, Inc. also include respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors, successors and assigns as well as authorized Users or beneficiaries of GetFeedback, Inc. Services. Subject to and without waiver of the arbitration provisions above, You agree that any judicial proceedings (other than small claims actions in consumer cases) will be brought in and You hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state courts in the City and County of San Francisco, California, or federal court for the Northern District of California.

    57. *Severability.* If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or otherwise unenforceable, it shall be deemed modified to render such provision enforceable while preserving the Parties' original intent to the fullest extent permissible, and the rights and obligations of the parties shall be construed and enforced accordingly. If any such provision cannot be modified in accordance with the foregoing, then that provision will be deemed severed from this Agreement and all other provisions will be unaffected and will remain in full force and effect. 

    58. *Waiver.* Any waiver by Us must be in writing. No waiver by either party of any breach of this Agreement shall be a waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach. No failure or delay in enforcing any right or provision under this Agreement shall be construed as a waiver of such right or provision or of any other right or provision. 

    59. This Agreement makes up the entire agreement and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, representations, and understandings, whether written or oral, concerning its subject matter. The headings in the Agreement do not affect its interpretation. References to sections are to sections of this document. This Agreement and any Ordering Document may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered or transmitted by facsimile, e-mail or other electronic means, shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute but one and the same instrument. A facsimile or electronic signature is deemed an original signature for all purposes under this Agreement and any Order Form.

**Congratulations. You have reached the end!**
